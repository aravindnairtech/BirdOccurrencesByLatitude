The goal of this project is to determine whether it is more than likely that a species of bird can exist in other places given an observation of a species and its location (via E-Bird Database). 

Input: E-Bird Database discoveries (from users worldwide who observe a bird species at a specific location
  - Location of Discovery
  - Bird Species Name
  
Output: 
  - Cities in which the bird can potentially exist in given similar living conditions.
  
Data that we are working with (aside from : 
  - Land Cover
  - Average Min/Max Temperatures
  - Topography
  
UPDATES MIGHT COME LATER, but for now, we are working with cities within California.
